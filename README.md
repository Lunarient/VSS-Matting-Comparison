# Video Semantic Segmentation & Video Matting Comparison

## Notes
- The three models of comparisson are currently sharing a docker volume and running as separate devcontainers running the official Anaconda3 devcontainer image
- Unsure if those are being picked up by the repo as right now they're just being listed as submodules. (This may need to be fixed, possibly by creating a single devcontainer at the root)
